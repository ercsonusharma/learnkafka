# Producer and Consumer API in Java

Maven build is needed to download the dependecies of Kafka
Any Consumer/Producer can be triggered from https://github.com/ercsonusharma/learnkafka/blob/master/src/main/java/com/sonu/kafka/App.java

Code written by assuming we have three broker nodes:
localhost:9091 , broker.id:101 
localhost:9092 , broker.id:102 
localhost:9093 , broker.id:103

and a zookeeper running on localhost:2181

Topics like hello-topic1 and Tweets have been used, which needs to be created before hand.
